<p> Homemade Jamaican patties recipe. This dish is one of the most famous and likeable Jamaican snacks, as it's great for on the go and has an even greater taste! Everybody loves patties! The flaky crust is delicious and is mainly filled with grounded beef mince, chicken, or saltfish filling and a variety of spices to satisfy your taste buds. When made from scratch at home, the mince have a much more fresh look to the ones in the shop, as the fillings are often processed for longevity. A bit of advice, eating it the next day always had a bit more flavour to the taste!
